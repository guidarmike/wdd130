    <h2>Michele Guidara</h2>
    <h2>You may call me Mike.</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! I am Michele Guidara from Rome, Italy. I completed Byu-Pathway recently and I decided to keep on
        studying in web development.
        But I am currently Looking to see what is the career that I want to pursuit. I served a full time mission,
        beginning in Autumn 2019 in Washington,
        Seattle, but then because of Covid I had to complete my mission in Italy, Milan mission, until the beginning of
        2021. Even if it was a less
        exciting experience, I had the chance to work on myself spiritually and I met a lot of good people. All these
        events leading me towards BYU.
        I have been a faithful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life. I believe that I
        should learn more and find new knowledge to add on my own. I am familiar with html and css because of curiosity
        but I wish to learn
        more through this class.
    </p>
    <p>Web development isn't a choice that came randomly in my mind. I like playing videogames but in the last few
        years, I have been slightly more
        interested about how I can see those things on my screens. This interest was also towards the web pages. It
        wasn't just the desire to maybe
        start a career about something that in a tech world is commonly needed, it is also because there are a lot of
        lenguages to express or show
        something like what I will learn in WDD 130. It will be a challenge as it is for learning a new leanguage but I
        believe that with desire and
        action, all is possible.
    </p>
